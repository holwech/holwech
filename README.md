## Hello!
On April 11th, 2023, I decided to all-in as a solo founder and indie hacker. I'm following the "build in public" philosophy and sharing my progress on the way. I strive to be as transparent as possible, sharing my metrics, goals and failures.

Follow me on my journey to build a profitable business from scratch [here](https://holwech.com).
